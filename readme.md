Embedded Fuzzy Logic v0.30
==========================

This is a simple fuzzy logic source code with Mamdani fuzzy inference
system (FIS), aiming for wide range of microcontroller's applications.
The codings have been successfully built and executed on Programmable 
System on Chip (PSoC) 5 by Cypress using ARM GCC 4.4.1 compiler. 

For simple applications, just modify the global resources in 
"user_param.h" and define the rules in "user_rules.h". 

Examples/descriptions are also provided inside the codes for user
guidance.
